Element05 (GameScene) - The code adheres to the principles outlined in the document you provided earlier. It incorporates physics, lighting, camera controls, and object interactions essential for a game environment. Proper modularity is maintained with the use of functions, enhancing code readability and reusability. Physics properties, animations, and shadow casting. 

Element05 (MenuScene) - The code adheres to the principles outlined in the document you provided earlier (the brief). It incorporates GUI elements, sound effect, and interactive button for creating a menu scene.

Common Features:

Both scenes start with importing necessary Babylon.js modules, including libraries for GUI, physics, and sound.

Physics and Mesh Import:

The GameScene involves the initialization of Havok physics, importing player mesh, and creating a capsule-shaped physics aggregate for player interaction.

User Input and Animation:

Keydown events are used for player movement, and animations are triggered based on the user's input. The scene handles collision detection and responds to the player colliding with specific objects.

Lighting and Environment:

Functions for creating various lights, terrain, ground, trees, and a skybox contribute to the visual richness of the game scene.

MenuScene:

User Interface (UI):

The MenuScene focuses on creating a menu environment with a GUI button. The button is associated with a sound effect, and clicking it triggers a scene index change.

Visual Elements:

Similar to the GameScene, the MenuScene includes a skybox and lighting elements to enhance the visual appeal.

The combined code provides a comprehensive foundation for a 3D game environment with interactive gameplay elements and a user-friendly menu interface. It aligns with best practices for Babylon.js development, emphasizing modularity and adherence to specified design principles.
